# IMP-and-Random-Pruning

This repository contains the work conducted for a course project in EE5179 - Deep Learning for Imaging. The project focuses on the implementation and evaluation of Iterative Magnitude Pruning and Random Pruning techniques. The repository includes the source code and the report submitted for the July-November 2023 Semester.

# Overview
In the realm of deep learning, pruning techniques play a significant role in model optimization and compression. This project delves into two distinct pruning methodologies:

Iterative Magnitude Pruning: This technique involves iteratively pruning weights with low magnitudes from the neural network.

Random Pruning: Unlike iterative magnitude pruning, random pruning randomly selects weights to prune from the network.

# Contents
Code: This directory contains the source code implementing the Iterative Magnitude Pruning and Random Pruning techniques.

Report: The report directory contains the detailed report submitted for evaluation as part of the course. It provides insights into the methodologies employed, experimental setup, results, and analysis.
